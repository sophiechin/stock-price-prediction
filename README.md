# Stock Price Prediction Model

This repository contains the implementation of Google Stock Price Prediction with a Machine Learning technique. The prediction model will use Python languaage with the dataset of Google Daily Stock Price 2023. Since Stock Price Prediction is one of the Time Series Forecasting problems, we will build an end-to-end Google Stock Price Prediction with a Machine Learning technique using the **LSTM Neural Network

## Libraries and Datasets
- **Dataset:** To build this stock price prediction model, we will use the **Google Stock Price 2023 Daily** dataset.
- **Libraries:** To develop this stock price analysis, we will use the Python libraries as the following:
  - Pandas
  - Numpy
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn
  - Sklearn
